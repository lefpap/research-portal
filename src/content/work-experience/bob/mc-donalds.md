As a cashier at McDonald's, I was responsible for processing customer orders, handling cash transactions, and maintaining a clean and organized work environment. I provided excellent customer service by greeting customers, answering questions, and resolving any issues they may have had. Additionally, I worked collaboratively with my team to ensure efficient operations and a positive dining experience for our customers. My time at McDonald's taught me valuable skills in communication, teamwork, and customer service, which I continue to apply in my professional career.

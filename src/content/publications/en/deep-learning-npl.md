## Abstract

In this publication, we present an in-depth analysis of modern deep learning techniques applied to natural language processing (NLP). We examine models such as Transformers and BERT, and discuss their impact on various NLP applications.

**Keywords:** Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence

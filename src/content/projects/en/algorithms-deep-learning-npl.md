## Project Description

In this project, we develop new deep learning algorithms that enhance the ability of systems to understand and process natural language. The project involves researching and applying neural networks to solve problems such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering.

**Objectives:**

- Develop new neural network architectures.
- Improve accuracy in natural language processing tasks.
- Create open-source code for the community.

**Participants:**

- Nikos Papadopoulos
- Dr. John Smith (external collaborator)

## Summary

The use of big data in environmental research allows scientists to analyze vast amounts of information related to climate change. Maria Ioannou stated that this data helps predict future environmental challenges and develop solutions.

## Code Example: Analyzing Climate Data with Python

To understand how big data can be used in analyzing climate change, let's look at a Python code example that loads and analyzes a temperature dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('climate_data.csv')

# Display the first 5 rows of the data
print(data.head())

# Calculate the average temperature per year
average_temp = data.groupby('Year')['Temperature'].mean()

# Visualize the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(average_temp.index, average_temp.values)
plt.title('Average Temperature per Year')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (Â°C)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

_Explanation:_

- **Importing libraries:** We use pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization.
- **Loading data:** We read a climate_data.csv file that contains temperatures per year.
- **Viewing data:** We display the first five rows to get an overview of the dataset.
- **Data analysis:** We calculate the average temperature for each year.
- **Visualization:** We create a line plot showing the change in average temperature over the years.
- **Adding grid:** We add a grid to the plot for better readability.
